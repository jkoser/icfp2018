This project is the result of my playing around with the task of the 2018 ICFPC.  Most of the code was written after the contest was over; one might consider it an entry for the Glacial Division.  In any event, I find it a fun challenge.

The code is written in [Typed Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), the typed flavor of an offshoot of a dialect of Lisp.  While I've used Racket for a couple of years now, this is my first significant use of Typed Racket.  If you have any suggestions for improvement, I would be most grateful.
